  <h1><a href="/">CV/Resum&eacute;</a></h1>
  <h2>Who I am</h2>
  <p>I am a developer mostly focused on dynamic languages like Ruby, but with knowledge of <span class="caps">PHP</span>, C# &amp; Java. I also have a big foundation in networking due to my first jobs into the IT area.</p>
  <p>I am a self-taught, pragmatic person, very much into the craft of building applications. I really enjoy what I do, and I wouldn’t trade it for nothing.</p>
  <p>If I am in a position of choosing a development methodology, I’ll choose to follow the Agile model.</p>
  <h2>What I am doing now</h2>
  <p><strong>Software Developer at Red Intercable Digital Buenos Aires 2007-Present Day</strong></p>
  <p>I am currently working on an application for a telecommunications company. The purpose of the app is to integrate the functionality of a <span class="caps">CRM</span> and a Network Provisioning service in order to concentrate the business information at one place only, and also to decrease the human error on network configuration tasks. This project is now in the final stages.</p>
  <p>I am also managing and developing several projects, most of them internal, all based on rails. The main project at this moment its a billing application that integrates all the corporate network clients in one place, provides a clean interface for billing, and helps dealing with the the current <span class="caps">AFIP</span> regulation.</p>
