# Lucas Efe (ripping Henrik's base structure)

This directory contains data for my blog, [Lucas Efe](http:/lucasefe.com.ar).

It's automatically transformed by my mutated version of [Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll) (Hyde? Mr. Haml?) into a static site. Jekyll was created by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).

## License

The following directories and their contents are copyrighted by me, Henrik Nyh, unless otherwise mentioned. You may not reuse anything in them without my permission:

* _posts/
* images/

All code of mine in the posts is under the MIT License unless otherwise mentioned.

All other directories and files are under the MIT License, but I ask that you do not use this exact design for another site (you can't have the pug, anyway). The design is based on MIT-licensed work by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).
