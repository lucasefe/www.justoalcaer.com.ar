h1. www.justoalcaer.com.ar (ripping Henrik's base structure)

This directory contains data for my band, [Justo al Caer](http:/www.justoalcaer.com.ar).

It's automatically transformed by my mutated version of [Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll) (Hyde? Mr. Haml?) into a static site. Jekyll was created by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).

All code of mine in the posts is under the MIT License unless otherwise mentioned.

All other directories and files are under the MIT License, but I ask that you do not use this exact design for another site (you can't have the pug, anyway). The design is based on MIT-licensed work by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).
